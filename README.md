# Prerequisites

To run the application locally, you will need to create the datacore and scenarios required for the application to work.
You can use the Flowcore CLI to create the datacore and scenarios, or you can use the Flowcore Platform to create them manually.

To create the datacores use the following commands:

```shell
npm install -g @flowcore/cli
```

then copy the `flowcore.local.example.yaml` file to `flowcore.local.yaml` and fill in the missing information. Then you
can run the following command to spin up an environment for development:

```shell
yarn flowcore:dev
```

this will create the required resources in the Flowcore Platform, inside your tenant.

> Requires the Flowcore CLI version 2.5.0 or higher.
> Production can be created with `yarn flowcore:prod`
> The command that is run under the hood for dev is `flowcore create -f flowcore.yaml -f flowcore.local.yaml`

## Setup Stripe CLI

Follow this [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli), To setup Stripe CLI on your machine. So you can easily interact with Stripe Webhooks

## Node Version Requirement

When running `yarn install`, you may get an error saying your Node.js version is outdated and you need to upgrade.

To run this app, you need Node.js version `20.11.0` or higher.

If you need to install a different Node.js version, you can use a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to switch between versions easily.

2. Go to [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard) and click on `Developers`
3. Click on `API keys` and copy the `Secret key` and `Publishable key`
4. Create `.env` file in your root folder
5. Copy the content inside the `.env.example` and paste it inside newly created `.env` file
6. Paste the `Secret key` as `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
7. Paste the `Publishable Key` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in the `.env` file
8. Run `yarn stripe:listen` in your terminal and then fill the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` directly from the terminal

# Tenants

Your tenant is part of the url when you go to your organization in the Flowcore Platform. For example, if you go to `https://flowcore.io/flowcore`, then `flowcore` is your tenant.
You can also see the tenant where you select between your active organizations in the top left corner of the UI.

# Clerk

You need to create an account with [Clerk](https://clerk.com) and create a new application. You need the two environmental variables `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` to be set in your `.env` file.

# Run locally

1. Clone the repository (or fork it if you intend to contribute)
2. `yarn`
